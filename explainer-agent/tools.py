"""Read-only chain tools exposed to this agent's LLM (ADK FunctionTool wrap).

Each entry in ``LLM_READ_TOOLS`` is a function from
``bnbagent_studio_core.tools.chain_readonly`` wrapped as an ADK ``FunctionTool``. The
LLM may call any tool in this list while producing the deliverable (the
``notify_funded`` work step); each function's docstring becomes the description
the LLM sees.

You own this file — edit ``LLM_READ_TOOLS`` to control exactly what your
agent can read on-chain. Lines for features your project doesn't use are
commented out by default; uncomment after you've added the dependency to
``studio.toml``.

**All tools are read-only** by the studio definition: no
on-chain state change, no transferable authority, no transaction signing, no
EIP-712 typed-data signing. The agent IS the sole on-chain signer,
but ALL of its signing — quote-sign, submit_result, settle, plus the
automatic budget-gated Pieverse LLM-credit auto-renew inside ``load_model()`` —
lives in ``signing.py`` as FIXED entrypoint code and is NEVER a tool the LLM
can invoke. The LLM only produces work text after a job is verified funded; it
can never price, sign, spend, or mutate chain state. Keep this list read-only.

(``pieverse_usage`` is the one exception in the underlying module: it does a
SIWE EIP-191 personal_sign, domain-locked to llm.pieverse.io, no on-chain
effect. It is commented out below.)
